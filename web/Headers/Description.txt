-------Writeup-------


On visiting the website, it says "Not an agent of the Secure-Browser". So we change the User Agent in Chrome with the help of 'developer tools' and 'network conditions' from browser default to "Secure-Browser". Upon visiting again it displays "Does not Accept nothing". So we override the header 'Accept' to "Nothing" with the help of a Chrome extention called "Requestly". Upon visiting again, it displays "Connection not secure" so we repeat the above process to override "Connection" to "secure". Upon visiting again, it displays "Want-Flag is not yes". So we create a new header "Want-Flag" and set it to "yes". Upon visiting again, it displays the flag.
